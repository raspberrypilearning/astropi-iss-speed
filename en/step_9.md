## Enter the third mission

Now that you have an approximation of the speed of the ISS, you can enter the third Astro Pi Challenge.

To refine your code and perhaps calculate a more accurate estimation of the speed of the ISS, you could try and investigate any of the following:

- Using a different feature detection [algorithm in OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d27/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_feature2d.html){:target='_blank'}
- Choosing a different number of feature matches to use
- Using more than 2 photos
- Checking how long a photo takes to be written to disk to get a more accurate value for the time between photos. 
- Does the curvature of the Earth have an effect on the actual distance values traveled?
- Does the height of the identified feature also have an effect?
- Does the angle of motion (diagonally across the frame) have a impact that needs to be corrected for?
